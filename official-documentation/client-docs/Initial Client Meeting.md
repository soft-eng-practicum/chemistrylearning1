Initial Meeting Summary:

We met our client this past Thursday, August 25th. 
During the meeting we discussed the purpose/ vision (both visually and what methods it should be deployed through). 
We initially went over what the game strategy/objectives would potentially look like. We asked the client what methods 
of communication and checkpoints should look like for them and if they would be able to supply the essential 
learning materials (formulas and correct answers) for the project. We gave advice and suggestions on how we plan on 
making every objective reasonably possible for this project. Lastly, we set up our next meeting time and what should 
be done and delivered by that time. Overall, the initial client meeting was a good starting point, well-received,and
productively collaborative. 

As a team, we have shared notes with one another from the meeting. 
We all agree, there is still a lot more information that is open for discussion with the client.
